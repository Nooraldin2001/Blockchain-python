# Blockchain Project

## Overview

This is a blockchain-based project designed to facilitate secure transactions and record-keeping, primarily focused on registering and validating image transactions. The project includes features such as wallet generation, image registration, and transaction validation.

## Features

- **Wallet Generation:** Users can generate blockchain wallets to securely store their public and private keys.
- **Image Registration:** Users can register images to the blockchain, recording details such as owner ID, image hash, and features hash.
- **Transaction Generation:** Registered images can be used to generate transactions, which are then validated and added to the blockchain.
- **Transaction Confirmation:** Users can confirm their transactions, specifying blockchain node URLs for validation and finalization.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with jQuery)
- **Backend:** Python (Flask framework)
- **Blockchain:** Custom blockchain implementation
- **Database:** SQLite (for storing blockchain data)
- **Libraries:** Bootstrap, DataTables, Font Awesome
